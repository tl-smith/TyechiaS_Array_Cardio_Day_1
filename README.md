# Array Cardio Day 1 â€” JavaScript30
Welcome to Array Cardio Day 1! This project is part of the JavaScript30 series by Wes Bos and is designed to level up your understanding of JavaScript array methods.

## Objective
By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:
- Understand JavaScript Array Methods

Recognize and explain the purpose of common array methods, including:

 - filter(): checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
 - map(): executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
 - sort(): used to sort the elements of an array in place.
 - reduce(): iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.

These powerful methods will help you write cleaner, more efficient, and more expressive JavaScript.

## Tech Used
- JavaScript 

- HTML/CSS 

- Browser Console (for testing and output)
